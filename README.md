# AI Chatbot in Python

A simple AI chatbot built with Python that interacts with users through the command line. 
It can respond to greetings, answer questions about AI and Python, tell jokes, and provide motivation. 
In the future, I plan to enhance this chatbot by adding **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** concepts as part of my studies.

## Features
- Responds to greetings like "hello" or "hi"
- Answers questions about AI, Python, and computer science
- Tells jokes
- Handles user emotions like happiness and sadness
- Strips unnecessary spaces and ignores capitalization for robust input handling

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abubakarsaddiqnamaaji/AI-CHATBOT-WITH-PYHTON.git
